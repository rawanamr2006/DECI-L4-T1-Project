I have provided a sample key file and password vault which were created while testing the app for taking screenshots.

The key : M@sterkey123

Please delete both the "vault.vlt" and "master_key.mkey" files if you want to test the app as a new user and explore full functionality. You can test it using the provided key and sample entries anyways, but for full experience you can do as mentioned.

Some Notes:

1. key and vault files are created in the same folder after successful key input. The files won't work with the program unless they are in the same folder and have the same names as the sample (as they are mentioned statically in the code) 

2. User input is validated at each point in the program and errors are handled effectively and tested by me

Thanks for your efforts. I have done my best and really hope you like my project !
